Trust role police types:

Here's a more detailed breakdown of all the potential role assumption scenarios in AWS:

1. Cross-Account Role Assumption
Scenario: A user or role in one AWS account (Account B) assumes a role in another AWS account (Account A).
Principal: IAM role or user from another AWS account.
Use Case: Cross-account access to resources between different AWS accounts.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountB_ID:role/RoleInAccountB"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
2. Service-Linked Roles
Scenario: AWS services automatically create and assume service-linked roles to carry out tasks on your behalf (e.g., Lambda, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk).
Principal: AWS services (e.g., ec2.amazonaws.com, lambda.amazonaws.com).
Use Case: AWS services requiring specific permissions to operate.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
3. IAM Role Assumption Within the Same AWS Account
Scenario: An IAM user or another role in the same AWS account assumes a different role (within the same account).
Principal: IAM user or role within the same account.
Use Case: Temporary permissions escalation within the same AWS account.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountA_ID:role/RoleInAccountA"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
4. Role Assumption by Federated Users (Web Identity Federation / SAML)
Scenario: Federated users (from external identity providers like Active Directory, Google, or via a SAML-based identity provider) assume an AWS role.
Principal: Federated identity via Web Identity Federation or SAML.
Use Case: Allowing third-party users or identities to access AWS resources via roles.
Web Identity Federation:
sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity is used for allowing users authenticated via a web identity provider (Google, Facebook, etc.) to assume a role.
Example: Users logging in via Cognito or external identity providers.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "cognito-identity.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
    }
  ]
}
SAML Federation:
sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML is used when users authenticate using SAML-based identity providers (such as Active Directory Federation Services or a third-party SAML provider).
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.0:assertion"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML"
    }
  ]
}
5. IAM Role Assumption with Temporary Credentials
Scenario: Any IAM role or user can request temporary security credentials to assume a role via sts:AssumeRole.
Principal: The entity making the call to assume the role (IAM user, role, application, etc.).
Use Case: Temporary elevated permissions for short-term tasks.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountA_ID:role/RoleInAccountA"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
6. Role Assumption by AWS Organizations Accounts (Cross-Account Access within AWS Organization)
Scenario: Cross-account role assumption between accounts within the same AWS Organization.
Principal: Any IAM role or user from accounts within the same AWS Organization.
Use Case: Simplifying role assumption and access control across multiple accounts in an AWS Organization.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/RoleInAccountB"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
7. Assuming Role with AWS Lambda (Lambda Execution Role)
Scenario: AWS Lambda functions assuming a role to access other AWS services (e.g., accessing DynamoDB, S3, etc.).
Principal: AWS Lambda service (lambda.amazonaws.com).
Use Case: Lambda functions need permissions to access AWS services or resources.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
8. EC2 Instance Profile Role (EC2 Instance Role)
Scenario: An EC2 instance assumes a role via an instance profile to interact with other AWS services.
Principal: EC2 service (ec2.amazonaws.com).
Use Case: Allow EC2 instances to access other resources such as S3, DynamoDB, or SQS.
Example Trust Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
9. Assuming Role with Resource-Based Policies
Scenario: The role can assume resources like S3 buckets or Lambda functions with resource-based policies that allow cross-account access.
Principal: IAM role from another account or AWS service.
Use Case: Allowing access to specific resources, such as an S3 bucket, Lambda function, or Step Functions from a different account.
Example Trust Policy for an S3 Bucket:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/RoleInAccountB"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
10. AssumeRole API (via Custom Applications or CLI)
Scenario: Custom applications or AWS CLI users call the sts:AssumeRole API to temporarily assume a role.
Principal: IAM user, application, or service making the call to sts:AssumeRole.
Use Case: Programmatic access where temporary credentials are needed to assume roles for specific tasks.
11. Service-Linked Roles (For Specific AWS Services like AWS Config, CloudTrail, etc.)
Scenario: AWS services like AWS Config, CloudTrail, or AWS CloudFormation assume a role to perform actions on your behalf.
Principal: Specific AWS services.
Use Case: Automating AWS service configurations or security monitoring.
Summary of Principal Types:
AWS Account Role: "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountID:role/RoleName"
AWS Service: "Service": "service-name.amazonaws.com"
Federated Identity: "Federated": "identity-provider-name"
IAM User: "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountID:user/UserName"
Temporary Role Assumption: By users, roles, or applications using STS AssumeRole API.
AWS Organization (Cross-Account): "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountID:role/RoleName"
Key Actions:
sts:AssumeRole
sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
sts:AssumeRoleWithSAML
These cover all the scenarios where you might use role assumption in AWS, including variations with services, federated identities, temporary credentials, and inter-account access.
