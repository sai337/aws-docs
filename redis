redis cluster mode diasbled: - you can create only 1 shard - which is one primary and 5 read replicas 

 Can have multilple logical databases - meaning ,we can map one application to one logical datase and redis clients (which are applications).
 if needed we can increase the logical databases on the parameter group to the number we need.
 
if the primary fails redis will choose or make another node as primary.

python client example to map the specific application to one logical database.

we can have backups 
 
 
Redis cluster mode enabled: can multiple shards - one shard is of one write (primary) and 0-5 read replicas.

with cluster mode enabled we cannot have the duplicate key values



Redis use formula - crc 16 (keyname) 16384 - which means when a client sends a request to store a key , it will assign a hashkey from the 0- 16384.

and those hashkey values can be distributed to the numnber of shareds we created.

one haskkey can store multiple keyvalues.
