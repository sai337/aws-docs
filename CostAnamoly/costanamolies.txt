can you explain this part, how its finding the expected or actual spend ?

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî this part is key to understanding how AWS Cost Anomaly Detection works behind the scenes.

üí° How AWS determines Expected Spend vs Actual Spend for anomaly detection
When you create an Anomaly Monitor, AWS automatically starts modeling your historical cost behavior using machine learning. Here‚Äôs what happens:

üìä 1. Expected Spend (Baseline)
AWS Cost Anomaly Detection builds a baseline model of your spending based on:

Your previous daily spend data (typically 30‚Äì90 days).

Trends and seasonality in your usage.

Past spikes and dips ‚Äî these are learned and excluded from the normal trend.

So, the expected spend is a machine-learned estimate of what your cost should have been for a specific day or period, based on prior patterns.

‚úÖ It's dynamic and updates as your usage changes over time.

üí∏ 2. Actual Spend
This is your real cost for a specific service, account, or usage type on that day ‚Äî pulled from:

AWS Cost Explorer / Billing service (which reports actual cost daily).

Uses detailed billing data (including usage, rates, discounts, etc.).

üîç 3. Anomaly is flagged when:
Actual Spend > Expected Spend + Threshold

If AWS detects that your actual spend is significantly higher than expected ‚Äî and not explainable by normal variance ‚Äî it flags that as an anomaly.

The detection is:

Per monitor dimension (e.g., per service or per account).

Daily granularity.

Detected after the day's billing closes (~1 day delay).

üß† Example:
Let‚Äôs say you have a monitor set on Service = Amazon S3. Here‚Äôs a simplified flow:

Date	Expected Spend	Actual Spend	Anomaly?
June 10	$4.80	$4.95	‚ùå No
June 11	$4.85	$5.05	‚ùå No
June 12	$4.90	$25.00	‚úÖ Yes

AWS will report:

Expected Spend	ML-estimated normal spend based on historical cost patterns
Actual Spend	Real AWS cost from billing on that day
Anomaly	Detected when actual spend greatly exceeds expected (above threshold)
