cloudfront can integrated with alb, s3 and ec2.

access s3 bucket with cloudfront.

- create the bucket as public and upload the files that you want to access from the browser
- create the cloudfront distribution and add the s3 bucket as origin 
- create the oai- origin access identity(like an in iam role to access the s3 with cloudfront)
- once distribution created, add the below bucket policy to s3 to allow the distribution access the objects in s3.

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

- create the public and private key using openssl, add the public to the list of public cert
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
- add the cert to the keygroups, once added in the behavior configuration choose the trusted key groups and choose the key group created earlier.
- choose the cache policy - for s3 caching optimized 
- once all configured, access the distribution endpoint from the browser with /index.html
- if you get below error:

<Error>
<Code>MissingKey</Code>
<Message>Missing Key-Pair-Id query parameter or cookie value</Message>
</Error>
 the cloudfront distribution you are trying to access is not singed one
 
- in order to make signed below are the process:
   1. canned policy
   2. custom policy
   
   while creating the singed url we use the private certificate we created earlier and define the time like how long the distribution url can be singed url and valid.
    cloudfront will validate the public added keygroup with private cert added singed url for handshake and route the traffic.
