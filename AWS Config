aws config will record the resource config changes and store them and send email notification with lambda.

we can use the aws given default config rules or else can develop our own.

 in order to record the config changes in aws account, first aws config recorder needs to enable. once it enable when a specific resources config changes it will invoke the sns notifition which will invoke lambda and send email notification.

in control tower env, config recorder changes will be stored in log archive account s3 bucket and audit account sns topic will send email alert about the non complaint resources.


complaint , non complaint.


Even to make an aws account pci-dss complaint, aws config will record the supported 58 services and look for changes in resources as defied in the config rule.
If any resouce get non complaint, as per rule sns will invoke lambda which will send an email notification.
In order to make an account pci-dss complaint, we need to write our own rules and apply them.
also need to enable the config recorder in all the supported services and regions.
need to enable the aws conig for supported services and for global services.
